## NLP TEXT SUMMARIZER

TEXT SUMMARIZATION : 

Text Summarization is the process of shortening long text into shorter text while retaining the key elements and meaning. Manually summarizing the text would take up a lot of time. Automating the process using state-of-the-art NLP models could be a solution to this.This problem can be solved using NLP in two ways:-

Extractive Text Summarization: This method aims to identify the most important sentences in a given text which is then extracted and grouped to form a shorter version of the text.

Abstractive Text Summarization: This method aims to create a brief and concise summary of a source text that captures the main points. The produced summaries may include additional phrases and sentences not found in the original text.
